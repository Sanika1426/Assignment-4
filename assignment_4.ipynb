        "## **Theory questions**\n",
        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming OOP?\n",
        " -  Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming style that organizes code using objects, which are instances of classes. It helps structure programs by bundling data (attributes) and behavior (methods) together.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        " - A class in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a blueprint or template used to create objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        " - An object in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is an instance of a class. It represents a real-world entity with data (attributes) and behavior (methods).\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        " - Abstraction:\n",
        "   Focus: Hiding complex implementation details and showing only the essential features.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Purpose: To reduce complexity by hiding the \"how\" and exposing only the \"what\".\n",
        "\n",
        "   - Example: When you drive a car, you use the steering wheel and pedals without knowing how the engine works.\n",
        "  \n",
        "   - Encapsulation:\n",
        "  Focus: Bundling data and methods that operate on the data into a single unit (class), and restricting access to parts of the object.\n",
        "\n",
        "   - Purpose: To protect data from unauthorized access or modification.\n",
        "\n",
        "   - Example: A class with private variables and public getter/setter methods to control access to the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        " - Dunder methods in Python (short for \"double underscore\" methods) are special built-in methods with names that start and end with double underscores like __init__, __str__, __len__, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOPH  \n",
        " - Inheritance is a key concept in OOP that allows a class (child/subclass) to inherit properties and behaviors (methods and variables) from another class (parent/superclass).\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        " - Polymorphism means \"many forms\". In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), it allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass, usually by overriding methods or using the same method name with different behaviors.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        " - Encapsulation in Python is achieved by restricting direct access to the internal data (variables) of a class and providing controlled access through methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        " - A constructor in Python is a special method used to initialize a new object when it is created from a clas.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are class and static methods in Python ?\n",
        " - In Python, both class methods and static methods are special types of methods that behave differently from regular instance methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "  - Method Overloading means defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameters (number or type), so the method behaves differently based on the arguments.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP?  \n",
        " -  Method overriding is an OOP feature where a subclass provides its own version of a method that is already defined in its parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        " - The property decorator in Python is used to turn a method into a read-only property, so you can access it like an attribute, but still run code behind the scenes.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "  - Polymorphism is important in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) because it enables flexibility, code reusability, and extensibility by allowing the same interface to work with different data types or classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "15.  What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        " - n abstract class in Python is a class that cannot be instantiated directly and is meant to be a base class for other classes. It can define abstract methods that must be implemented by its subclasses.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        " - OOP helps create programs that are organized, reusable, secure, flexible, and easier to maintain, which is why it's widely used in modern software development.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        " - Class variable: Same for all objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Instance variable: Different for each object.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "  - Multiple Inheritance is a feature in Python where a class can inherit from more than one parent class. This allows the child class to access attributes and methods from multiple base classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python?\n",
        " -   Purpose of __str__ and __repr__ Methods in Python\n",
        "Both __str__ and __repr__ are special (dunder) methods in Python used to define how an object is represented as a string. They serve different audiences and purposes:\n",
        " -  __str__() – User-Friendly Representation\n",
        "Called by: print() and str() functions.\n",
        "\n",
        " -  Purpose: Return a readable, human-friendly description of the object.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Goal: For end users.\n",
        "  - __repr__() – Developer-Friendly Representation\n",
        "Called by: repr(), interactive shell, and debugging tools.\n",
        "\n",
        " - Purpose: Return an unambiguous string that ideally can recreate the object.\n",
        "\n",
        " - Goal: For developers and debugging.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?\n",
        " - The **super()** function in Python is used to call methods from a parent (super) class inside a child class. It plays a key role in inheritance and code reuse.\n",
        " - Key Purposes of super():\n",
        "Access parent class methods (especially constructors) from the child class.\n",
        "Avoid duplicate code by reusing functionality.\n",
        "Supports multiple inheritance using Method Resolution Order (MRO) safe\n",
        " - Especially Useful In:\n",
        " - Constructor chaining\n",
        "\n",
        " - Method overriding\n",
        "\n",
        " - Multiple inheritance (to avoid calling a method multiple times)\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        " - Significance of the __del__ Method in Python\n",
        "The __del__ method in Python is a special (dunder) method known as the destructor. It is automatically called when an object is about to be destroyed, typically when it goes out of scope or is deleted.\n",
        " -  Purpose:\n",
        "Used to clean up resources (like closing files, network connections, releasing memory) before the object is removed from memory.\n",
        "Used to clean up resources (like closing files, network connections, releasing memory) before the object is removed from memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        " -  Difference Between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python\n",
        "Both @staticmethod and @classmethod are decorators used to define special types of methods inside a class, but they behave differently in how they access class or instance data.\n",
        "\n",
        " - @staticmethod – Simple, Self-Contained Function\n",
        "Doesn’t need access to class or instance.\n",
        "\n",
        " - Behaves like a regular function inside a class.\n",
        "  -  @classmethod – Works with the Class (cls)\n",
        "Gets the class as the first argument.\n",
        "Can be used to access or modify class-level variables or to create alternative constructors.\n",
        "python Copy Edit\n",
        " - In Short:\n",
        "Use @staticmethod when the method doesn’t need access to the class or instance.\n",
        "Use @classmethod when the method needs to work with the class itself (like modifying class variables or creating alternative constructors)\n",
        "\n",
        "23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        " - Polymorphism in Python with inheritance allows objects of different subclasses to be treated as objects of a common superclass, while each subclass can override methods to provide its own specific behavior\n",
        " -  Key Concepts:\n",
        "Inheritance allows child classes to inherit methods from a parent class.\n",
        "Method Overriding allows a child class to redefine a method from the parent.\n",
        "Polymorphism lets you call the same method on different objects, and Python will automatically call the correct version based on the object's class.\n",
        " - How It Works:\n",
        "All subclasses (Dog, Cat) inherit from Animal.\n",
        "They override the speak() method.\n",
        "When make_sound() is called with any subclass object, Python uses the correct method according to the object’s actual class, not just the reference type (Animal).\n",
        " - Polymorphism with inheritance in Python allows you to write flexible and reusable code that works across different object types, as long as they share a common interface or base class\n",
        "\n",
        "24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        " - Method chaining in Python is a technique where multiple methods are called in a single line, one after another, on the same object.\n",
        "Each method returns the object itself (typically self), allowing the next method to be called directly.\n",
        "\n",
        "25.  What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        " - The __call__ method in Python is a special method that allows an object to be called like a function.\n",
        "\n",
        " -  Purpose:\n",
        "To make instances of a class behave like functions.\n",
        "Enables objects to be \"callable\", i.e., use object() syntax.\n",
        "Useful for function wrappers, stateful functions, caching, etc.\n",
        "\n",
